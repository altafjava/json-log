### This project generate log files in two formats

* application-text.log:- which is a normal text log. By using splunk we can find the logs easliy.
* application-json.log:- which is a json log. This is very useful if we are using Kibana because Kibana supports only in JSON format.

**Note:** you can remove the section that pertains to application-text.log if you would like to only log json, and never look at text ever.
